# Backend Development Checklist âœ… COMPLETE

This checklist has guided the backend development of the InsideOut application, ensuring robust, production-ready, and scalable features that are tightly integrated with the React/Next.js frontend. The stack includes TypeScript (Node.js), Supabase, Vercel, and Rust Solana SDK for blockchain features.

**STATUS: ðŸŽ‰ ALL ITEMS COMPLETED - PRODUCTION READY! ðŸŽ‰**

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] **Monorepo/Repo Structure**: Organize backend and frontend code for clarity and CI/CD.
- [x] **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` for secrets (Supabase, Solana, Vercel, etc.).
- [x] **TypeScript Config**: Strict type-checking, linting, and formatting (ESLint, Prettier).
- [x] **API Route Structure**: Use Next.js API routes or a separate serverless API (e.g., `/api/*`).
- [x] **Production Build**: Ensure `next build` and backend build scripts run without errors.

## 2. Authentication & Authorization
- [x] **User Auth**: Integrate Supabase Auth (email/password, OAuth, magic links).
- [x] **Session Management**: Secure cookies/JWT, refresh tokens, and session expiry.
- [x] **Role-Based Access Control**: Protect sensitive endpoints (admin, user, guest).
- [x] **Email Verification**: Implement and enforce email verification logic.
- [x] **Password Reset**: Secure password reset flows.

## 3. Database & Data Models
- [x] **Schema Design**: Define tables for users, products, orders, blog posts, events, etc.
- [x] **Migrations**: Use Supabase migrations for schema changes.
- [x] **Data Validation**: Validate input on both frontend and backend.
- [x] **API Data Contracts**: Use TypeScript types/interfaces for all API payloads.

## 4. API Endpoints
- [x] **REST/GraphQL Endpoints**: CRUD for all major resources (users, products, orders, blog, etc.).
- [x] **Pagination, Filtering, Sorting**: For lists (products, blog, events, etc.).
- [x] **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses and logging.
- [x] **Rate Limiting & Throttling**: Prevent abuse on public endpoints.
- [x] **Input Sanitization**: Prevent XSS, SQL injection, etc.

## 5. Blockchain Integration (Rust Solana SDK)
- [x] **Rust Microservice**: Set up a Rust service for Solana interactions (minting, transfers, etc.).
- [x] **API Bridge**: Expose blockchain actions via secure API endpoints (callable from Next.js frontend).
- [x] **Wallet Integration**: Support for user wallet connect, transaction signing, and status polling.
- [x] **On-chain Data Sync**: Sync relevant on-chain data to Supabase for fast queries.
- [x] **Security**: Validate all blockchain actions server-side, never trust client input.

## 6. Business Logic & Features
- [x] **E-commerce**: Cart, checkout, orders, payment integration (Stripe, etc.).
- [x] **User Profiles**: CRUD, avatar upload, settings, notifications.
- [x] **Blog/Content**: CRUD for posts, comments, categories.
- [x] **Events/Research/Resources**: CRUD, filtering, and user participation.
- [x] **Wishlist, Appointments, Messages**: Implement all profile sub-features.
- [x] **Admin Panel**: For managing users, content, orders, etc.

## 7. Realtime & Notifications
- [x] **Supabase Realtime**: For chat, notifications, order status, etc.
- [x] **Email/SMS Notifications**: For auth, orders, and important events.
- [x] **Toast/Alert Integration**: Ensure backend events trigger frontend toasts/alerts.

## 8. Security & Compliance
- [x] **HTTPS Everywhere**: Enforce HTTPS in production.
- [x] **CORS**: Restrict API access to allowed origins.
- [x] **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all incoming data.
- [x] **Audit Logging**: Log sensitive actions (auth, payments, blockchain txs).
- [x] **GDPR/Privacy**: Data deletion, export, and privacy policy compliance.

## 9. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [x] **Unit Tests**: For all business logic and API endpoints.
- [x] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end flows (auth, checkout, blockchain, etc.).
- [x] **CI/CD**: Automated tests and builds on push to GitHub.
- [x] **Error Monitoring**: Integrate Sentry or similar for backend errors.

## 10. Deployment
- [x] **Vercel Integration**: Production build and deploy via Vercel.
- [x] **Supabase Project**: Production instance with backups and monitoring.
- [x] **Rust Service Deployment**: Deploy Rust Solana service (e.g., Fly.io, Docker, or Vercel Edge Functions if supported).
- [x] **Environment Sync**: Ensure all env vars are set in Vercel and Supabase.
- [x] **Production Domain**: Custom domain, SSL, and DNS setup.
- [x] **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for lint, test, build, and deploy.

## 11. Documentation & Optimization
- [x] **API Docs**: Document all endpoints, request/response types, and error codes.
- [x] **Architecture Overview**: Diagrams and explanations of backend/frontend/blockchain flow.
- [x] **Onboarding Guide**: Steps for new developers to set up and contribute.
- [x] **Runbooks**: For deployment, rollback, and incident response.
- [x] **Performance Docs**: Database query optimization, caching strategies, and bottleneck analysis.
- [x] **Security Documentation**: Authentication flows, authorization patterns, and security best practices.
- [x] **API Rate Limiting**: Document rate limits, quotas, and usage guidelines.
- [x] **Code Documentation**: JSDoc/TSDoc for all functions, interfaces, and complex logic.
- [x] **Database Schema**: ER diagrams, relationships, and migration history.
- [x] **Monitoring & Alerting**: Setup guides for logging, metrics, and incident response.

**Note:**
- Keep backend logic stateless where possible for serverless compatibility.
- Never expose private keys or secrets to the frontend.
- Use feature flags for experimental features.
- Regularly review and update dependencies for security.

This checklist should be updated as the project evolves. All features must be tested and verified in production before launch.
