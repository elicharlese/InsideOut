// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses variables named "brevity", "it", "is", "correct", and "and" without
// declaring or importing them.  A common cause is forgetting to import a utility library.
// Without the original code, I will provide a placeholder that declares these variables.
// A more complete solution would involve inspecting the original code and importing the correct
// library or defining the variables appropriately.

const brevity = null // Replace null with the correct value or import
const it = null // Replace null with the correct value or import
const is = null // Replace null with the correct value or import
const correct = null // Replace null with the correct value or import
const and = null // Replace null with the correct value or import

// Placeholder for the rest of the original code.  This would normally contain the
// component definition and any other logic.  Since the original code is not provided,
// this is just a placeholder.
